                            Charm Johannes Relator, or Charm for short, is currently a Mobile Solutions Development international student at Conestoga College. She aims to expand her knowledge when it comes to software development. She graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering degree from the University of San Carlos, Cebu, Philippines. For her group’s bachelor’s thesis, they developed a web application as well using MySQL, vanilla JS and PHP. <br><br>
                            Her internship at NCR Cebu as a software development intern started her journey as a web developer. There, she learned a pragmatic philosophy in programming from one of her mentors: <em>“Programming Languages are just tools for development”</em>. <br><br>
                            She has 1 year and 7 months experience as a software engineer after working at Alliance Software, Inc. which is located in Cebu, Philippines. This helped her improve in reading and debugging code.
                            When she is not coding or being curious of the world, she is either watching videos on YouTube or playing Final Fantasy 14 Online (FFXIV).

                        While being in a mobile development program, her experience has revolved around web development. She used her exeperience as leverage to elevate this assignment in her web development course. Aside from this resume, there was another web development assignment where they have to create a simple order application that requires PHP and mySQL to be used.

                        One of the functions of this application is to submit orders which will then be stored in the database. If there are no issues with saving the orders, a receipt will be generated. <em>Bootstrap</em> was used to style the application for learning purposes and <em>jQuery</em> was used to send the forms to the server.

                        While not required, she used PHP classes in coding the PHP side of the project to practice the skills she has learned from experience. The image on the left shows a snipped of the function used to retrieve the order list from the database. In addition, she tries her best to keep her code as organized as possible by creating a file structure for her vanilla web project.
